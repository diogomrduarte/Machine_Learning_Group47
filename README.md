The New York Workers’ Compensation Board (WCB) oversees the claims process, having reviewed over 5 million cases since 2000. 

This project aims to automate the classification of claims by predicting the Claim Injury Type using Machine Learning models, leveraging labeled data from 2020 to 2022 for training and validation. 

The project workflow included exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, handling missing values and outliers, encoding categorical variables, feature engineering, and scaling. 

Feature selection techniques were applied to optimize model performance. 

Various predictive models were developed and evaluated to determine the most accurate approach for classifying claims. By implementing this solution, the decision-making process in workers’ compensation is streamlined, significantly reducing manual effort while enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and consistency in claim classification.
